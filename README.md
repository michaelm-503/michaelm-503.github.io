## Process Engineer | Data Scientist | Chemist

### Work Experience

- **Engineering Manager, Intel Corporation**, 3/2022-7/2025
    - Automated ingestion and visualization of maintenance data (SQL, Python, JMP) to enable engineers, technicians, and people managers to measure performance and identify problems in real-time, **reducing maintenance rework events by 50% and eliminating $8M+ annually in waste**.
    - Developed a new model for manufacturing output and capacity to improve forecasting of equipment purchases, **avoiding $42M in unnecessary tool purchases without impacting factory output**.
    - Led a factory-wide effort that achieved a two-quarter acceleration of factory retooling. Coordinated roadmaps and held teams accountable to meeting planned metrics. **Saved $8.5M without impact to output, operations, or customers**.
- **TD Module Manager, Intel Corporation**, 3/2022-7/2025
    - Developed regression-based automated process control to decrease product variability and eliminate a device reliability flaw. **Increased total product yield by 2%, resulting in $50M+ in annual savings**.
    - Built a KPI dashboard to enable daily tracking of metrics and Pareto-driven process improvement, **leading to a 14% increase in equipment productivity and avoiding $12M in equipment purchases**.
    - Applied lean strategies to reduce maintenance duration times by 33%, **leading to $2M annual labor savings**.
    - Developed an onboarding course utilizing a “lab” format to guide new engineers through creating their first automated report using internal scripting tools.
- **Process Engineer**, Intel Corporation, 3/2022-7/2025
    - Automated real-time statistics across 150+ process sensors to detect drift and halt processing at the first signs of failure. Utilized anomaly detection and regression to determine yield and quality correlations. Implemented process changes and equipment upgrades that **reduced scraps from 5% to 1% and saved $10M+ annually**.
    - Developed a unified factory operations dashboard integrating multiple data sources (SPC, MES, FDC), **reducing manual data handling by 125+ engineer-hours weekly**.
